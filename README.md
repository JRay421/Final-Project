Analysis of Breast Cancer statistics and how they factor in to making a diagnosis - Benign or Metastatic

For completion of the Final Project requirement of the Entity Academy / Woz-U Data Science curriculum

A collaborative project of Sarah Hagans, Candy Linde, and Jasmine Ray

## Week 1: Project Planning
##### Completed on January 23, 2022

The dataset was found on Kaggle and was created by M Yasser H

### Breast Cancer Dataset
* [Breast Cancer](https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)

### Variables Used
#### Independent Variable:
* Diagnosis
#### Dependent Variables:
* Area Mean
* Compactness Mean
* Symmetry Mean
* Smoothness Mean
* Concavity Mean
* Concave Points Mean

## Week 2: Data Wrangling
##### Completed on January 30, 2022

Data was created into a subset with only our needed variables. We also cleaned and recoded for analysis and machine learning predictions

#### Data Wrangling Notebook:
* [Wrangling Notebook](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Breast%20Cancer.ipynb)
#### Data Wrangling R:
* [Wrangling in R](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Data%20Wrangling.R)

## Week 3: Exploratory Analysis
##### Completed on February 6, 2022

Our exploratory analysis included 

* [Histograms](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Histograms.R)

## Week 4: Analyze Data
##### Completed on February 13, 2022

To analyze our data we completed a stepwise binary linear regression and binary logistic regression to see the influence each variable had on diagnosis.

#### Stepwise Binary Linear Regression:
* [Stepwise Regression](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Stepwise%20Regression.R)

#### Binary Logistic Regression:
* [Smoothness_mean](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Smoothness%20Logistic%20Regression.R)
* [Symmetry_mean](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Symmetry%20Logistic%20Regression.R)
* [Concavity_mean](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Concavity%20Logistic%20Regression.R)
* [Concave.Points_mean](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Concave%20Points%20Logistic%20Regression.R)
* [Area_mean](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Area%20Logistic%20Regression.R)
* [Compactness_mean](https://github.com/JRay421/Final-Project/blob/main/Code/Compactness%20Logistic%20Regression.R)

## Week 5: Data Visualization and Reporting
##### Completed on February 20, 2022
